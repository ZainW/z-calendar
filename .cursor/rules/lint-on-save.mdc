- Linting is not enforced on commit, but should be run automatically on file save.
- Instruct all contributors to enable the following in their `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "typescript",
    "vue"
  ]
}
```
